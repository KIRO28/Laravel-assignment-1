Approach for this assignment:

I had created a new branch name reactDev where i created two function to retrive all the blog posts and a specific blog post on the basis of _id. As, this application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The routes are defined in routes/web.php for web interactions and routes/api.php for API endpoints. Controllers handle business logic, while Blade templates manage the views. The application uses Laravelâ€™s built-in authentication and authorization features to manage user access and roles. It was not that difficult to solve this assignment as, I did most of them by watching recorded videos from mylean and also did went through the some videos and websites to implement the API.
